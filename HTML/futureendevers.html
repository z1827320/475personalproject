                    <p>
                        After graduating from NIU I plan on finding a job for a few years and debate going back to school for my Masters degree.
                        I have a few jobs that I would like to look into, but I might have to go outside of my hometown to finds employment.

                    <h3>10-15 years from now</h3>
                    <p>
                        In ten to fifteen years from now I will have either gone back to school and gotten my Masters or said I don't have the time and gone to work for my family.
                        My family owns a manufactoring business in my hometown. With my experties I would like to try to update some of the processies that happen at the shop.
